# Get_Homologues
- Clustering protein and nucleotide sequences in homologous (possibly orthologous) groups, on the grounds of sequence similarity.
- Identification of orthologous groups of intergenic regions, flanked by orthologous open reading frames (ORFs), conserved across related genomes.
- Definition of pan- and core-genomes by calculation of overlapping sets of proteins.

## Step 1
We need to create a new folder
~~~
mkdir get_homologues_clus
cd get_homologues_clus
~~~
{: .source}

~~~

{: .output}

## Step 2
Use clustering COGtriangle algorithm (COGS, PubMed=20439257)
~~~
get_homologues.pl -d /home/betterlab/GenomeMining/datos/gbk -e -G 
~~~
{: .source}

~~~

## Step 3
Use orthoMCL algorithm (OMCL, PubMed=12952885)
~~~
get_homologues.pl -d /home/betterlab/GenomeMining/datos/gbk -e -M 
~~~
{: .source}
