questions:
- "What is a pangenome?"
- "What are the principal componenets of a pangenome?"
- "Which means 'open pangenome' and 'closed pangenome'?"
- "How can I perform a pangenome analysis?"

objectives:
- "To learn to perform a pangenome analysis by using different bioinformatic tools"
keypoints:
- "The pangenome is the entire set of genes from all strains of a clade."
- "The principal components of a pangenome are: 'core', 'shell', and 'dispensable'"
- "Open pangenome ocurrs when the size of the pangenome increases considerably every added genome (p. e. *Escherichia coli*)"
- "Closed pangenome ocurrs when only few gene families are incorporated to the pangenome when a new member of the clade is added." 
- "A pangenome can be obtained by gathering and computing the complete genome sequence of the members of a clade by using specialized bioinformatic tools"
