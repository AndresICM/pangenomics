title: "Introduction to pangenomics"
teaching: 10
exercises: 10
questions:
- "What is the meaning of *pangenome*?"
- "What kind of biological data are analyzed in a pangenome?"
- "What factors affect the structure of a pangenome?"

objectives:
- "Understand the concept of *pangenome*"
- "Define the different subsets of the *pangenome*"
- "Learn which biological data are needed as inputs in a pangenome analysis"
- "Discuss applications and questions that could be solved with a pangenome analysis"

keypoints:
- "The pangenome is the entire set of genes from all strains of a clade."
- "The principal subsets a pangenome are: 'core', 'shell', and 'dispensable'" genome.
- "An *open pangenome* occurs when the size of the pangenome increases considerably every added genome"
- "A *closed pangenome* occurs when only few gene families are incorporated to the pangenome when a new member of the clade is added" 
- "A pangenome can be obtained by comparing the complete genome sequences of all members of a clade."
