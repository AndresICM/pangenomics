In this lesson you will learn the basic theory of the study of Pangenomes, you will download and annotate public genomes using command-line software. 
Most importantly you will conduct pangenomic analysis with three specialized programs, which include clustering of gene families, construction of 
interactive pangenome graphs and visualize neighbournig gene families.

As you progress through this lesson, keep in mind that even if you aren’t going to be doing this same workflow in your research, you will be learning 
some very important practices about using command-line bioinformatics tools. What you are going to learn here will enable you to use a variety of 
bioinformatics tools with confidence and greatly enhance your research efficiency and productivity.

> ## Prerequisites
>
> This lesson assumes a working understanding of the bash shell. If you haven’t already 
> completed the lesson [Introduction to the Command Line for Pangenomics](https://czirion.github.io/shell-pangenomics/), and you aren’t 
> familiar with the bash shell; please review those materials before starting this lesson.
>
> This lesson also assumes some familiarity with biological concepts, 
> such as prokaryote genome, gene and orthology.
> 
> This lesson uses data hosted on an Amazon Machine Instance (AMI). Workshop participants
> will be given information on how to log in to the AMI during the workshop. Learners using 
> these materials for the self-directed study will need to set up their own AMI or install programs in their personal computers. Information 
> on setting up an AMI and accessing the required data is provided on the 
> [Pangenomics Workshop Setup page](https://czirion.github.io/pangenomics-workshop/setup.html).
