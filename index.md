**Welcome** to this lesson on the fundamental principles of **Pangenomics**, a rapidly advancing field in bioinformatics. Throughout this course, you will delve into the fundamental theories that underpin the study of pangenomes. By utilizing **command-line** software, you will gain hands-on experience in downloading and annotating public bacterial genomes, acquiring essential genomic analysis skills.  

One of the key highlights of this course is the opportunity to engage with specialized programs designed for pangenomics analysis. You will master the art of **gene family clustering**. You will become adept at constructing **interactive pangenome graphs and plots**, powerful visualization tools for studying the general structure of a pangenome and the families composing it. You will finally explore how to apply **Topological Data Analysis** to studying pangenomes.

The analyses presented here were meticulously curated to equip you with the necessary tools for conducting a starting pangenomics pipeline. By refining your bioinformatician skills through practical application, you will not only gain confidence in your abilities but also be well-prepared to **explore diverse resources** (See [Other Resources](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/pangenomics/13-other-resources/index.html)). With this, you can go ahead and develop your personalized workflow tailored to the specific objectives of your pangenomics research.   

Get ready to embark on this exciting journey into the world of **Pangenomics**, where you will unlock new insights and unravel the complexities of genomic variation!

> ## Pre-requisites
>
> Before diving into this lesson on Pangenomics, it is essential to have a working understanding of the **Bash shell** and the **language Python**. If you are not already familiar with these programming languages, we recommend completing the [Introduction to the Command Line for Pangenomics](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/shell-pangenomics/) lesson before to starting this one and [Introduction to Python for Pangenomics](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/pangenomics-python/). 
> 
> Additionally, some familiarity with biological concepts is assumed for this lesson. Having a basic understanding of **prokaryote**, **genomes**, **genes**, and **orthology**is beneficial. If you are new to these concepts, we encourage you to review relevant materials to ensure you have a solid foundation for this course. 
> 
> Throughout this lesson, we will utilize data hosted on an **Amazon Machine Instance (AMI)**. Workshop participants will receive information on how to log in to the AMI during the workshop. If you are studying independently, you must set up your own AMI or install the necessary programs on your computer. Detailed instructions on setting up an AMI and accessing the required data can be found on the [Pangenomics Workshop Setup page](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/pangenomics-workshop/setup.html).  
> If you are taking this workshop in **UNAM-CCM**, you will access the shell and Python and have access to all the bioinformatics programs through a [JupyterHub server](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/pangenomics-workshop/setup.html#connection-to-jupyterhub-notebooks-and-terminal).
